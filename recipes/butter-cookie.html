        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div style="padding-right: 1100px;"> Butter Cookies II recipe from AllRecipes is a classic treat known for its rich, buttery flavor and simple preparation. To make these cookies, you start by creaming together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Then, you mix in an egg and a touch of vanilla extract for added depth. The dry ingredients—flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt—are combined separately and then gradually added to the wet mixture, creating a smooth dough. After chilling the dough briefly, it's rolled out and cut into shapes using cookie cutters. The cookies are baked until just golden around the edges, resulting in a delightful balance of crispness and tenderness. Decorate as desired for a personalized touch.</div>
