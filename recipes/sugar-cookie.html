        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div style="padding-right: 1100px;">
            An easy sugar cookie recipe usually starts with creaming together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Eggs and vanilla extract are then beaten in to add richness and flavor. In a separate bowl, dry ingredients like flour, baking powder, and salt are whisked together. The dry ingredients are gradually mixed into the wet ingredients to form a soft dough.
The dough is often chilled for a short time to make it easier to handle. Then it's rolled into small balls or dropped by spoonfuls onto baking sheets. The cookies are baked in a preheated oven until the edges are lightly golden, usually about 8-10 minutes. After cooling on the baking sheet for a few minutes, they're transferred to a wire rack to cool completely. The result is a batch of tender, sweet cookies with a slightly crisp exterior and soft interior, perfect for decorating or enjoying as-is.
